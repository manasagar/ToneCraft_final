Working

The books in the form of pdf gets pre-processed with the help of ml/dl libraries and simultaneously emotion analysis takes place . Through emotional analysis the pdf gets divided into chunks and segments having a particular emotion for every segment. These segments/chunks with extracted emotions are then converted into audio files with the help of amazon Polly web services with proper tone , pitch , speed and emphasis and sound like human voices.


The pdf from the local device can be accessed on the NFT Marketplace . The NFT Marketplace acts as a storage for the audio files in the form of NFTs which can bought by the public using Ethereum coins using MetaMask wallet. Once the NFT is bought it gets removed from the NFT Marketplace therefore creating zero chances of piracy . With the help of NFTs , a full transparency layer with security is established between the buyer and the seller , thereby no third party person can alter the purchase creating a more secure platform for the authors to publish their books .
